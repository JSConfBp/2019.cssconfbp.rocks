        The Quick Version
      </h2>

      <p>
        CSSConf Budapest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
        everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
        body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
        in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
        including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
        violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
        *without a refund* at the discretion of the conference organizers.

        The Less Quick Version
      </h2>

      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
        deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
        or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
        contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should
        not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
        should not use sexualized  clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any
        action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
        concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can
        be identified by a yellow conference shirt with the word 'STAFF' on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case you can’t find a staff member, Anikó is always there for you:
        <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/hubudibu"><span>@hubudibu</span></a>,
        <a href="mailto:aniko@bpweb.io"><span>aniko@bpweb.io</span></a>,
        <a href="tel:036704262628"><span>+36704262628</span></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
        law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
        feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
      </p>

      <p>
        We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and
        conference-related social events.
